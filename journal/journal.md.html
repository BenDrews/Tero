2016-11-16: Adding GUI
=====================================================
Raymarching from the debug camera position, and see if it hits a voxel. Pressing the space key adds a voxel at the position. 

Trying to implement cross hair. Added in Textcoord0. 

2016-11-14: Implementing addVoxel (Lylia + Youle)
=====================================================
We reused Youle's code for adding voxel faces given the center of a voxel and the normal of the face.

Given the center of a voxel in voxel space (where positions are all integers), addVoxel checks if there is already a voxel adjacent to it in every direction. For each direction, if there is no adjacent voxel, it adds a face in that direction.

![Here, the centers of each face are not being calculated correctly.](firstAddVox.png)

Then we had the addFace method take the center of the voxel and a normal, and using that, calculated where each vertex of the face should be.
We add those vertices to the CPUVertexArray of our member ArticulatedModel, and then add the indices of those vertices to the CPUIndexArray.

![Now all the faces are in the right place, but the indexing of the vertices of each face is not correct.](betterAddVoxel.png)

![Using his voxel expertise, Youle fixed the indexing and we can successfully add a voxel to our scene!](bestAddVoxel.png)

2016-11-14: Adding ArticulatedModel to scene (Lylia)
=====================================================
Worked on creating an ArticulatedModel and adding it to the scene as a VisibleEntity at runtime. I had trouble getting the model to actually show up, but we realized it was because when I was adding vertices to the CPUVertexArray, I kept rewriting the same single vertex instead of adding new vertices.
