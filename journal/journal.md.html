2016-11-17: Circle Selection
====================================================
Added hooks for selecting a cyclindric section of voxels with the 'l' key press. You can then elevate a selection by holding down 'u' and dragging the mouse. The copying done by the elevateSection method takes a concerningly long time.

2016-11-16: Ground
=====================================================
Added in initial ground:

Something concerning here is that with 400 voxels, there is slight but noticable lag when moving about the scene. When a 10,000 voxel scene was attempted, by the time the 500th voxel was being added, addVoxel was taking a nontrivial amount of time. If we want to have 10,000 voxels possible, there needs to be some multithreading/optimizations. 

2016-11-16: Removing Voxels
=====================================================
Initially we tried to only have visible voxel faces represented in the geometry. Errors were encountered with removing certain faces. We then discovered that there was a mistake in how the voxel geometries were being names by addVoxel. Currently we are trying to work out a bug with removeFace, where the code is not even being compiled, in spite of the breakpoint set at the line calling removeFace being hit. 

Additionally the 'raymarch' is giving us problems, in that voxels are often placed in areas where the mouse is not. I tried dividing the mouseXY positions by the window dimensions and then multiplying by the renderDevice dimensions, but that did not seem to help at all. Likely there is some mismatch of window dimensions and renderDevice dimensions leading to a misguided ray. Perhaps we should just intersect the scene with the built in g3d method.

2016-11-16: Adding GUI
=====================================================
Raymarching from the debug camera position, and see if it hits a voxel. Pressing the space key adds a voxel at the position. 

Trying to implement cross hair. Added in Textcoord0. 

2016-11-14: Implementing addVoxel (Lylia + Youle)
=====================================================
We reused Youle's code for adding voxel faces given the center of a voxel and the normal of the face.

Given the center of a voxel in voxel space (where positions are all integers), addVoxel checks if there is already a voxel adjacent to it in every direction. For each direction, if there is no adjacent voxel, it adds a face in that direction.

![Here, the centers of each face are not being calculated correctly.](firstAddVox.png)

Then we had the addFace method take the center of the voxel and a normal, and using that, calculated where each vertex of the face should be.
We add those vertices to the CPUVertexArray of our member ArticulatedModel, and then add the indices of those vertices to the CPUIndexArray.

![Now all the faces are in the right place, but the indexing of the vertices of each face is not correct.](betterAddVoxel.png)

![Using his voxel expertise, Youle fixed the indexing and we can successfully add a voxel to our scene!](bestAddVoxel.png)

2016-11-14: Adding ArticulatedModel to scene (Lylia)
=====================================================
Worked on creating an ArticulatedModel and adding it to the scene as a VisibleEntity at runtime. I had trouble getting the model to actually show up, but we realized it was because when I was adding vertices to the CPUVertexArray, I kept rewriting the same single vertex instead of adding new vertices.
