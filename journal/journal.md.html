2016-12-06: added a castle
=======================================================
Added methods `importVoxFile` `importMagicaVox` which gets the vox input file and puts it into the scene. 
It creates empty Any files and creates 256 new materials which pushes back the color materials and the debug materials

Having fun with ghost castle (it looks weird, because you can see through the voxels, and some of them are missing)

2016-12-06: debugging shockwave
========================================================
So for some reason, when I used the ray grid iterator with a ray with an origin anywhere but the center of our voxel world, it resulted in the shockwave going in two directions and occasionally halting the animation.

To fix this I simply always iterate over a ray with an origin at the world origin. Then I just add a point3int32 offset to get to the real voxel that I want to test.

2016-12-05 patch 6.23
====================================================
changed the r button  into mouse scrolling so we can change the intersecting distance by scrolling.
fixed a minor bug in elevate
added a `addRainbowMaterial` method that adds colors to the voxels by specifying the global constant `rainbowSize` .
added a helper method `addRainbowLine` for debuging and visualizing the colors. 

![](rainbowBlocks.jpg)


2016-12-05: Selection modes
=====================================================

Put in basic infrastructure for changing selection modes.

To do:
1. Test that set minus and set intersect work correctly
2. Test that set unions overlapping don't break anything
3. Give `Selection` access to voxIsSet()
4. Changing selection modes should have a UI (text flashes on screen telling what mode you're in)
5. If mode is setMinus or setIntersection but the current selection is empty, want to just add to the selection normally
6. Material for visualizing selections should not be reflective

2016-12-05: Making mountains
=====================================================

Once the interface was in place for making animations, it was easy to start adding a mountain transform. I started off by just successively adding circles with smaller radiuses on top of each other, decrementing the current radius and incrementing the current height each time. I had the transform stop when radius reached 0. The results were cones:

![](firstmountains.png)
![](firstmountains2.png)

To get some variation, I added some random noise in the y coordinate of the voxel points, and updated the radius and height only if a random integer that was chosen was 1.

![](randommtns1.png)
![](randommtns2.png)

An issue is that the final size of the mountains are being determined mostly by the radius, since we stop adding to the mountain when the radius reaches 0. We would like the mountain to be determined by the height specified by the user input. Here is a larger mountain I made by initializing the final radius to be the height from UI:

![Looks more like a hill than a mountain.](hill.png)

Also, making mountains makes the program lag a lot since the number of faces drastically increases. Setting the voxels in the mountain itself also results in some lag.

2016-12-05: Adding a shockwave
========================================================
Now that we had an animation infrastructure, I added a shockwave animation that pushed voxels up out of the ground in a line away from the player. I used a ray grid iterator to iterate over our voxels in the direction of the look ray.

I had some issues with the ray grid iterator, but after staring at it and the way Youle used it, I was able to make the voxels move. There are still some bugs in this animation that I will fix at a later time.

2016-12-04: Sound
=====================================================
Added sound effects by changing g3dSpec.audio to true in the main method. Then all we had to do was make an `Array` of `Sound`s we will use and call `play` in the methods where we want a sound effect.


2016-12-04: Debugging crater
=====================================================
The crater not being shaped right and appearing in the wrong place were just due to some stupid typos I made.

The other errors were being caused by creating extra copies of the args table and creating a new shared pointer every time the `invoke` method is called, causing table values to not be updated correctly.


2016-12-03: Updating Selection
=====================================================
Attempted to change how the sphere select worked so that the crosshair looks instead at the intersection of the plane normal to the camera/center ray with the crosshair ray. For a long time it did not work because the coordinates were in voxel coords and were being treated as if they were world space coordinates. 

2016-12-03: Animating the creation of a crater
======================================================
When we make craters in the world, we don't want the craters to disappear instantaneously, but gradually. For example, starting from the center, we one ring to disappear until a crater of the given radius is reached.

To do this, we added a class called `AnimationControl` that holds the function associated with a transform that will affect the world, the time since the last "step" of the animation, and the absolute time since the start of the animation. When a transformation function is called (`makeCrater`), it generates a lambda function (the animation function) and passes it to an `AnimationControl`. `App` stores an array of `AnimationControl`s (`m_animControls`) that is iterated through in `onSimulation()`. The lambda functions associated with each `AnimationControl` in `m_animControls` is invoked in `onSimulation()`.

I implemented all of this using `makeCrater`, but there are some bugs. All of the voxels in the crater disappear simultaneously, the crater doesn't start at the center specified by the user input, and the crater is not shaped like a circle.

![](flawedcrater.png)


2016-12-01: Changing the debugDrawVoxel
======================================================
Made a new model called debugModel, and as we select, it adds transparent voxels to the model. It removes the voxels as we deselect it.

![Selection visualization and updated non-VR GUI](selectionvisualization.png)


2016-12-01: Adding Voxels and some cleanup
=====================================================
It was pretty trivial to add more voxels at this stage.

![](moreVoxels1.png)
![](moreVoxels2.png)

I also converted a few of our tables into arrays because we were simply treating them as arrays.

2016-11-30: Fixing UI menu
==================================================
So the blocks weren't being drawn because we weren't computing the normals. This was fixed by calling the methods found in update geometry in the makeMenuModel method.


I also messed with the getMenuPositions method. It looks better now and is ready for our 16 voxel types!
![](vrMenu.png)


2016-11-29: Adding a better UI menu
====================================================
Today I worked on adding voxel models to the selection menu with Lylia. We wanted to procedurally generate these models, just like we did with the voxels, to avoid having more state in the form of an obj file.

We were able to get the models to appear in the scene, but for some reason they had no textures.
We will fix this tommorrow.

I also made a function that return positions in an arc to make the UI menu look cool.


2016-11-29: Workaround to bugs
==================================================
Fixed the bug by adding a single mesh to the CPUVertexArray and indexArray. 
	  
Moved `cleanGeometry`, `clearAttributeArrays` and `clearIndexStream` into `cleanChunkGeometry`, so that it's only called in `redrawChunks` and `addVoxel` methods.

debugDraw the selection voxels.

PRESS F FOR FORCE INTERSECT(IT GOES THROW WALLS). Press again to return to normal.

Press R to change the max intersect distance(which is also used for force intersect).


2016-11-28: Redraw lags
===================================================
Even when redrawWorld is called every time a voxel is deleted, sometimes voxels don't immediately disappear when deleted. Also, shadows that deleted voxels cast on other voxels don't immediately disappear even if the deleted voxel immediately disappears.

When there is only one type of voxel in the world, everything works fine. But when there is more than one voxel, there is lag when voxels are being removed. Also, when a voxel is placed adjacent to or close to one that has been removed but hasn't disappeared, the display updates.

After placing and deleting countless voxels, in a stroke of genius, Ben determined that it was the last voxel in each chunk that was becoming what we have newly christened "ghost voxels" (voxels that hang around after they're deleted).

Finally, we resolved the bug by realizing that after we cleared the CPU vertex and index arrays in the redrawChunk method, we 


2016-11-28: After break tweaks
===================================================
fixed a small bug in intersection method. changed the debugdraw shape to a cube. 


2016-11-27: Adding VR User Interface and Fixing VR lag
========================================================
We were having some lag on our VR inputs. This was because there was a loop in VRapp that was checking all the vrevents, meaning that they wouldn't be in the queue when we went to look for them. Once that was gone, our vr lag was gone.

Then I added a user interface. This consisted of two debug spheres floating in front of the player. These only show up when the player clicks a certain button on the controller. This activates menu mode. Then the player is able to select a new voxel type using the controller that activated menu mode.

2016-11-20: Small tweaks
===================================================
Fixed the intersection code, if you would like to change the boundary, just change the voxelBound in cameraIntersectVoxel method. 

But be aware, if you make it too big, the program will be very slow if you are not directly pointing at a voxel. (currently it's at `1 << 15`). Also instead of using the `voxelToWorldSpace` method (which adds `Point3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f)` to the original conversion), I just timed the position by voxelRes, it made the program more accurate.(not sure why)

There is still a problem with world ray, the farther we are from the point (0,0,0), the more skewed it is.

I also changed the getChunkCoords method by adding -1 to any negative x or z values, I'm not sure if that affects the rest of the code (I don't think it does).

![Picture that justifies adding -1 to negative x or z values with general chunk size of 8. If we do not, the chunks around (0,0) are too big.](chunkdiagram.jpg)

Added `checkBoundaryAdd`, which fixes the previous bug by checking whether the voxel is next to another chunk and updating the neighboring chunks if that's the case. I also removed `runConcurrently` in `updateChunks` method, because it didn't work with the new code, and I'm not exactly sure why.


2016-11-20: Chunking
===================================================
In an effort to improve performance, the main data structure used was changed to a chunk system. The chunks work as an intermediary step so that rather than refreshing the entire world on a block change, we only need to refresh a single chunk. There currently are some inconsistencies around the edges of chunks, since messing with the border means the neighbor needs to change, but isn't being refreshed.

![Chunk Edge Bug](ChunkBug.jpg)

Additionally, the intersect function seems completely thrown off by the change to chunking. Also the performance boost is still not enough. And there is a runtime error when moving a selection that contains voxels from different chunks. However we can generate worlds that are much larger than before.

![Decent Size](DecentSize.jpg)


2016-11-19: Adding vr controller support
===================================================
I was able to add it so that when the game is hooked up to the vive, the controller positions are shown and the selection object is based off of one of the controllers.

There seemed to be a weird offset between the HMD and the controllers in the scene. I fixed this by applying an offset of 0.05,0,4 to the vive controllers, but I emailed Morgan so maybe I'll find a better solution to this in the future.

2016-11-19: Tried to implement materials
===================================================
I tried to change the materials, but apparently removing the voxel is very difficult. Commited it anyways, since it doesn't affect the orginal program withought changing the slider. 

I was thinking, maybe we can not use culling, since it doesn't really reduce that much surface anyways(At most suffering from having the space twice as big.)

*Ben:* No, we need culling. It cuts down the faces by much more than half. 

2016-11-17: Adding Selection object and selection Preview
==================================================

In order to make the transition to vr easier, we added a selection object. This object will store what direction we are looking in for the ray marching and what position our selection "object" is. In the non vr mode, this is simply driven by the mouse and the camera, but in vr we will tie these to one of the vive controllers.

Once we had that, I made it so debug spheres were drawn on the voxel we had selected and its adjacent face. This is temporary, until we come up with a better way of drawing these objects, but it will help us until make a selection entity.

![](selectionPreview.mp4)

2016-11-17: How to use an ArticulatedModel
====================================================
After conferring with our fearless instructor Morgan McGuire, we were told that it's really really slow to have each voxel have its own geometry and mesh, so we restructured our program so that all of the vertices of all the voxels in the scene are added to the same geometry. However, adding many voxels at one time is still extremely slow. For example, it takes a very long time to initialize the ground or copy large sections of existing voxels.


2016-11-17: Material initialization
====================================================
To have voxels of different textures, we want to have a set of existing materials to map voxel types to. To do this we have to initialize all the materials at the start of the program. We are currently trying to create a UniversalMaterial from an Any, but we can't use PARSE_ANY because the file name for the texture of each material will be different, so we can't just type it in, we need to generate a new String for each material. We tried creating an Any from a string, but the UniversalMaterial::create method is currently reading that Any just as a String and not as an Any, so it thinks that the filename is the whole Any.

 
2016-11-17: Circle Selection
====================================================
Added hooks for selecting a cyclindric section of voxels with the 'l' key press. You can then elevate a selection by holding down 'u' and dragging the mouse. The copying done by the elevateSection method takes a concerningly long time.

![Circle Selection](CircleSelection.jpg)


2016-11-16: Ground
=====================================================
Added in initial ground:

![](Ground.jpg)

Something concerning here is that with 400 voxels, there is slight but noticable lag when moving about the scene. When a 10,000 voxel scene was attempted, by the time the 500th voxel was being added, addVoxel was taking a nontrivial amount of time. If we want to have 10,000 voxels possible, there needs to be some multithreading/optimizations. 

2016-11-16: Removing Voxels
=====================================================
Initially we tried to only have visible voxel faces represented in the geometry. We wanted to remove adjacent faces when adding voxels to the scene, but we encountered errors causing faces to be missing from the voxel we are currently adding and existing faces to disappear from existing voxels when we add to the scene.

![When we add voxels, faces are missing and other faces disappear](additions.png)

![](buggyAdd.png)

![The scene from below before adding a voxel to the bottom](beforeAdd.png) ![The scene from below after adding a voxel to the bottom](afterAdd.png)

We discovered that there was a mistake in how the voxel geometries were being named by addVoxel. Currently we are trying to work out a bug with removeFace, where the code is not even being compiled, in spite of the breakpoint set at the line calling removeFace being hit. 

Additionally the 'raymarch' is giving us problems, in that voxels are often placed in areas where the mouse is not. We tried dividing the mouseXY positions by the window dimensions and then multiplying by the renderDevice dimensions, but that did not seem to help at all. Likely there is some mismatch of window dimensions and renderDevice dimensions leading to a misguided ray. Perhaps we should just intersect the scene with the built in G3d method.


2016-11-16: Adding user input
=====================================================
At first I tried to make a player entity that set the camera and moved around, but I realized that this infrastructure would have to work with the vr side of this all, so I decided to postpone that until we knew how the vr would work and simply use the debug camera.

I added user input so that whenever the user presses space, a voxel is placed next to an existing voxel. This intersection was done using ray marching and it works fairly well. There are some innaccuracies however, so perhaps another intersection method should be implemented in the future. Ben had an idea for an analytical intersection but we still need to hash out that idea a bit more.

At first, the intersect ray that we were casting was through the center of the screen, but without a crosshair, this was difficult to aim. Now the intersect ray is dependent on the mouse position. This still has issues but is more accurate.

2016-11-16: Adding GUI and Texture
=====================================================
Raymarching from the debug camera position, and see if it hits a voxel. Pressing the space key adds a voxel at the position. 

Trying to implement cross hair.
Added in Textcoord0 for texture. Basically each point on the face of the voxel is assigned a Point2 value with x and y being either 0 or 1.

2016-11-14: Implementing addVoxel
=====================================================
We reused Youle's code for adding voxel faces given the center of a voxel and the normal of the face.

Given the center of a voxel in voxel space (where positions are all integers), addVoxel checks if there is already a voxel adjacent to it in every direction. For each direction, if there is no adjacent voxel, it adds a face in that direction.

![Here, the centers of each face are not being calculated correctly.](firstAddVox.png)

Then we had the addFace method take the center of the voxel and a normal, and using that, calculated where each vertex of the face should be.
We add those vertices to the CPUVertexArray of our member ArticulatedModel, and then add the indices of those vertices to the CPUIndexArray.

![Now all the faces are in the right place, but the indexing of the vertices of each face is not correct.](betterAddVoxel.png)

![Using his voxel expertise, Youle fixed the indexing and we can successfully add a voxel to our scene!](bestAddVoxel.png)

2016-11-14: Adding ArticulatedModel to scene
=====================================================
Worked on creating an ArticulatedModel and adding it to the scene as a VisibleEntity at runtime. We had trouble getting the model to actually show up, but we realized it was because when we were adding vertices to the CPUVertexArray, we kept rewriting the same single vertex instead of adding new vertices.

2016-11-12: Asking for permission to use the vive
======================================================
Today I asked for permission from Jonathan Leamon to boot from an external hard drive onto the vive computer. I got the go ahead, but the boot menu seemed to be locked with a bios password. I emailed Mr. Leamon to let him know about this. Hopefully we will be able to get access to this in the future.
