Introduction 
==================================
Our program allows users to edit a scene in real time by adding or removing voxels to the scene. Users can choose from a number of differently colored or textured voxels to add to the scene. Additionally, users can apply interesting transformations to the voxels in the scene, like making craters, raising mountains, and digging caves. 

Specification
==================================
**Features of the program:**

1. User is able to place and destroy a variety of different voxel types in real time
    - Models are edited without writing to disk
    - Option to save your model is available

2. Program is compatible with virtual reality headsets and controllers, and the user can move around in 3D space

3. User is able to apply interesting transforms to the voxels in the scene, for example:
    - Making a crater in the world
    - Raising mountains
    - Digging caves
    - Ideally these wouldn't happen instantaneously (we want to see the mountain being raised)
    - Button user interface (on game controls) that determine what operation we are performing on the scene

4. User is able to change how the world is scaled

5. Voxel painting
    - Existing set of voxels with different colors and textures to choose from when adding to scene
    - User can change the color/texture of any voxel that has already been placed in the scene

**Stretch goals:**

1. Implement marching cubes algorithm to make smooth surfaces

2. Add visual user interface in VR

3. Add physics simulation so we can throw voxels around

4. Make data structures more efficient

 ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
 makeLTree            | Creates Meshes for a tree and the leaves of the tree, constructs an LGenerator to create the skeleton of the tree and write the skeleton to an OBJ file, handles logic of passing the right phenotype and branch callback function based on chosen parameters in GUI
 generateOrchard      | Generates and displays a Scene.Any file of multiple fruit trees based on the parameters in GUI
 customOrchard        | Generates the orchard used for our quality image
 generateForest       | Generates the forest used for our quality image
