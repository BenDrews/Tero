Introduction 
==================================
Our program allows users to edit a voxel world in real time by moving around the world and placing or destroying voxels in the scene. Users can choose from a number of differently colored or textured voxels to add to the scene. Finally, users can apply interesting transformations to the voxels in the scene, including making craters, raising mountains, making shockwaves, and pulling voxels from the world into an orbit around the user. The program is compatible with Vive virtual reality headsets and controllers.

Specification
==================================
**Features of the program:**

1. User is able to place and destroy a variety of different voxel types in real time
    - Voxels are 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 m
    - Voxels can be added to an unlimited space.
    - User can add unlimited numbers of voxels, but at a large number of voxels we do not guarantee performance.
    - Models are edited without writing to disk
    - Option to save your model is available

2. Program is compatible with Vive virtual reality headsets and controllers, and the user can move around in 3D space

3. User is able to apply interesting transforms/animations to the voxels in the scene, for example:
    - Making a crater: The user can specify a center and radius $r$ and create a crater of depth $d$ related by $d = \sqrt{r}$.
    - Raising mountains: The user can specify a center and a height and create mountains with some amount of noise.
    - Creating a shockwave: The voxels in front of the user move up and down in a wave pattern until there are no more voxels to raise.
    - Orbital: Voxels are torn away from their positions in the world and start orbiting the user. The user can then fling them in different directions.
    - Transforms are animated and do not happen instantaneously.
    - Transformation menu in Virtual Reality that determines which operation we are performing on the scene when non-dominant grip is pressed.

4. Selection: User can select groups of voxels.
    - Cylinder: The user can specify a center and a radius to select a cylinder of voxels of height eqaul to the diameter.
    - Sphere: The user can specify a center and a radius to select a sphere of voxels.
    - Box: The user can specify a center and a radius (half an edge length) to select a box of voxels.
    - Set union: Selection mode that allows users to add to their current selection.
    - Set intersection: Selection mode that allows users to select voxels by performing a set intersection with two previous selections.
    - Set minus: Selection mode that allows users to remove from their current selection.

 5. Intersection: A crosshair visualizes the where in the scene the user is pointing.
    - User can switch between intersection modes. The first returns the first voxel position in the direction the user is pointing. The second attempts to intersect an existing voxel in the scene. Intersection modes are toggled with the 'f' key outside of VR. This feature is not implemented in VR.
    - The intersection distance can be changed, so far away empty voxel positions and close empty voxel positions can both be intersected. The intersection distance is controlled with the mouse scroll wheel outside of VR. This feature is not implemented in VR.

6. Virtual Reality User Interface
    - The user teleports through the world by ....
    - When you grip the left controller, a control panel with all of the voxel types pops up in the scene in the user's left hand that the user can interact with by pointing at it with the right controller and pulling the trigger
    - **TODO: other controls**

7. Non-VR User Interface
    - Use G3D debug camera for head position
    - User navigates the world using same controls as moving the debug camera (w, a, s, d, and mouse right-click)
    - User places voxels by left clicking the mouse
    - User destroys voxels by pressing the mouse scroll wheel
    - Although the colored voxel types exist, the user can only access the first eight textured voxel types to add to the world through a GUI pane drop down menu or the number keys '0' - '7'.
    - 'f' toggles intersection modes.
    - Intersection distance can be changed with mouse scroll wheel.
    - User can select voxels by holding and releasing various keys on the keyboard ('j' for box, 'k' for cylinder, 'l' for sphere)
    - 'n' toggles selection modes.
    - Transforms are performed by holding and releasing various keys on the keyboard ('p' for crater, 'o' for shock wave, 'i' for mountain, and 'b' for orbital).
    - 'm' causes a graphic voxel type menu to appear in the world, but it is used for debugging purposes only and has functionality only in virtual reality. Menu pages are navigated using 't' and 'y' keys.

8. Rendering
    - Use G3D built-in renderer. There will be shadows but no indirect lighting.

9. Audio
    - Sound effects for placing voxels, removing voxels, and opening and closing the menu.

10. User can import MagicaVoxel objects as templates
    - One model at a time.

**Program evaluation metric:**

1. What is the maximum amount of voxels in the scene before noticeable performance decay?

2. Are the controls intuitive?
    - Survey of other people (Juchan, Tony, other classmates)


Topic Overview 
==================================

Voxel world editors have become quite common since the advent of Minecraft. For our project, we want to use this archetype and combine it with the VR experience. Our goal is to give users the impression that they are shaping the world with their motions.

We use one ArticulatedModel, `m_model`, to store the geometries and meshes for all of the voxels in the scene. The voxels in the scene are divided into Chunks based on their x and z coordinates. Each Chunk spans a 32 x 32 voxel space region. `m_model` has separate geometries and meshes per Chunk and material. For example, the vertex and index arrays for a grass voxel and a stone voxel in the same Chunk region are still stored in different geometries and meshes because they have different materials. The Chunk system is a huge optimization because when a voxel is deleted in one Chunk, only the voxels in that Chunk have to be redrawn instead of all of the voxels in the scene.

We have two reference frames for the position of each voxel in the world, voxel coordinates and world space coordinates. Voxel coordinates are integer coordinates of the center of each voxel in the scene. They make it much easier to determine whether a voxel is already occupying space in the world and ensure that voxels do not overlap each other. Voxel space coordinates are also used to map voxels to corresponding Chunks. World space coordinates store the actual position of the center of the voxel in the scene.

We maintain several data structures to keep track of the voxels in the scene:

- Each `Chunk` stores its coordinates and a Table that maps voxel positions of voxels in the Chunk to their types.

- `m_voxToMat` is an Array that stores the `UniversalMaterial`s used for each voxel type.

- `m_posToChunk` is a Table that maps voxel positions of voxels in the scene to the `Chunk`s they are stored in.

- `m_chunksToUpdate` is an Array that stores Chunk positions of Chunks that have been changed and need to be redrawn.

- `m_voxToProp` is a Table that maps `int`s that represent each voxel type to `Any` files that contain a list of its properties. Currently the list contains its material and whether or not it is rounded, but this feature has not yet been implemented. We maintain this data structure as a placeholder for future extensions that will add more properties to the voxel types, such as transparency, emissivity, and if the voxel should have a hit box (tangibility).

- Finally, `m_selection` stores the current `Selection`. The `Selection` contains an Array of voxel positions and can perform set operations on it.

To add a voxel to the scene, we first add it to the appropriate Chunk. Next, we fetch the geometry and mesh that corresponds to the voxel's Chunk and type and modify the CPU vertex and index arrays. We are careful not to add new faces if the pending voxel is adjacent to an existing voxel in the scene. This drastically reduces the number of faces in the scene and ensures that the program does not waste time drawing faces that aren't visible.

When we remove a voxel, we first remove it from the Chunk it is stored in. Next, we fetch the geometry and mesh that correspond to the voxel's Chunk and type, and clear the CPU vertex and index arrays of the geometry and mesh. Then, for each type in a Chunk, we use the Chunk tables to redraw the geometry in that Chunk. This is the simplest way to remove voxels because if we tried to remove a voxel by manually removing that voxel's vertices from the CPU vertex array, then the indexing for the geometry of the other voxels in the Chunk would be messed up.

To create animations (shock wave and orbital) and transforms that appear gradually (crater and mountain) we created a new class called `AnimationControl`. `AnimationControl`s store a callback function that actually affects the voxel world and a `SimTime` member variable that keeps track of the time since the animation started. The animation functions in App create a lambda function for their corresponding animation, initialize an `AnimationControl` with that lambda function, and add the `AnimationControl` to `m_animControls`, an array of currently executing `AnimationControl`s in App. In `onInit()`, we call `invoke()` for each of the `AnimationControls` in `m_animControls`. At the end of the callback function for each `AnimationControl`, we check if the animation is finished, and if it is, we set `lastAnimFinished`, a global variable in App, to true. At the end of each iteration of the for loop in `onInit()`, if `lastAnimFinished` is true, we remove the current `AnimationControl` from `m_animControls`.
