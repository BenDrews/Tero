Introduction 
==================================
Our program allows users to edit a scene in real time by adding or removing voxels to the scene. Users can choose from a number of differently colored or textured voxels to add to the scene. Also, users are able to change the color/textures of existing voxels in the scene. Finally, users can apply interesting transformations to the voxels in the scene, like making craters, raising mountains, and digging caves. The program is compatible with virtual reality headsets and controlers, and the user can move around in the scene they created.

Specification
==================================
**Features of the program:**

1. User is able to place and destroy a variety of different voxel types in real time
    - Models are edited without writing to disk
    - Option to save your model is available

2. Program is compatible with virtual reality headsets and controllers, and the user can move around in 3D space

3. User is able to apply interesting transforms to the voxels in the scene, for example:
    - Making a crater in the world
    - Raising mountains
    - Digging caves
    - Ideally these wouldn't happen instantaneously (we want to see the mountain being raised)
    - Button user interface (on game controls) that determine what operation we are performing on the scene

4. User is able to change how the world is scaled

5. Voxel painting
    - Existing set of voxels with different colors and textures to choose from when adding to scene
    - User can change the color/texture of any voxel that has already been placed in the scene

**Stretch goals:**

1. Implement marching cubes algorithm to make smooth surfaces

2. Add visual user interface in VR

3. Add physics simulation so we can throw voxels around

4. Make data structures more efficient


**Program evaluation metric:**

1. What is the maximum amount of voxels in the scene before noticable performance decay?

2. What kinds of transformations can be applied to the scene?

3. Are these transformations easily repeatable? (Are the controls understandable)

Topic Overview 
==================================

Voxel world editors have become quite common since the advent of Minecraft. For our project, we want to use this archetype and combine it with the VR experience. Our goal is to give users the impression that they are shaping the world with their motions. 



Design
==================================

Our program will work by having a main controller which creates an ArticulatedModel representing the entire voxel world. We will use a hashmap from integer positions to voxel type ids and color masks to store a compact representation of this world. Along with a hashmap from voxel type ids to voxel properties, these data structures will be used to turn the user's input into the appropriate edits of the main ArticulatedModel.

**Major functions of App**
 Function             | Description                                                
 ---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
 initializeModel      | Initializes an ArticulatedModel that will be edited at runtime when user input is received
 addVoxel             | Based on position and type of voxel received from user input, uses m_voxToProp to add a voxel to the scene by modifying the main ArticulatedModel, and updates m_posToVox
 removeVoxel          | Based on position received from user input, removes the voxel at that position from the scene by modifying the main ArticulatedModel, and updates m_posToVox
 paintVoxel           | Based on position and type of voxel received from user input, uses m_posToVox to locate an existing voxel in the scene and uses m_voxToProp to change the texture/color of the selected voxel
