2016-11-14: Adding ArticulatedModel to scene (Lylia)
=====================================================
Worked on creating an ArticulatedModel and adding it to the scene as a VisibleEntity at runtime. I'm having trouble getting the model to actually show up, and I think possible issues could be:
 - The model doesn't have a material so it doesn't show up
 - The vertex indexing is wrong and all the faces are inside out (though I doubt this is the case)
 - Can't index faces as quads, need each face to be a tri in the mesh
